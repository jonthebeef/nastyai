# Product Requirements Document: Nasty AI Command Center

## Project Overview

The Nasty AI Command Center is a sophisticated management tool for a home media server (NAS) with its primary control system running on a Mac. It translates natural language commands into system commands executed on a Raspberry Pi via SSH, offering both web and Discord interfaces for interaction.

## Core Features

### Command Processing
- Natural language command translation
- Secure SSH-based execution
- Real-time output streaming
- Command interruption capability

### User Interfaces
- Web-based dashboard with split-panel design
- Discord bot integration
- Live command feedback
- Process monitoring and control

## Target Users

- Home media server administrators
- Technical users familiar with system administration
- Enthusiasts interested in AI-enhanced system management

## Use Cases

### 1. Web Interface Command Execution
1. User accesses dashboard via LAN
2. Enters natural language command
3. System translates and executes command
4. Real-time output displayed in terminal panel
5. Command can be interrupted if needed

### 2. Discord Integration
1. User sends command with prefix in Discord
2. Bot forwards command to command center
3. System processes and executes command
4. Bot provides execution feedback
5. Status updates sent to Discord channel
