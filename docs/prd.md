Title
 Mac Command Center for Raspberry Pi NAS

Overview
 This project is a management tool for a home media server (NAS) where the primary “brain” runs on a Mac. The command center translates natural language commands (with potential DeepSeek API integration) into system commands that are executed on a Raspberry Pi via SSH. Users can interact with the system through a web interface and Discord. The web interface splits into two panels—a chat input area and a live stream of the terminal output—to let the user both issue commands and monitor their execution in real time. Additionally, the interface provides a “Stop” command feature to interrupt running processes.

Objectives
 • Provide a centralized, LAN-accessible command center that enables natural language command input and real-time feedback.
 • Allow system administrators to control NAS functions on a Raspberry Pi from a Mac-based interface.
 • Integrate with Discord to accept commands via chat, broadening the channels through which the system can be managed.
 • Enhance transparency by displaying the live conversion of natural language to terminal commands, and the command’s execution output, allowing administrators to verify actions and stop processes if necessary.

Target Audience
 • Home media server administrators
 • Power users comfortable with system administration
 • Enthusiasts wanting an AI-enhanced natural language interface to manage a NAS

Key Use Cases
 1. A user logs into the web interface from a device on the LAN and enters a natural language command (e.g., “What is the RAID status?”) in the chat panel.
 2. The command center translates the command (initially using a dummy translator, later via the DeepSeek API) and executes the corresponding system command on the Raspberry Pi via SSH.
 3. The live terminal panel streams the output of the command in real time so the user can monitor the process.
 4. The user can stop a running command by clicking a “Stop Command” button, which sends an interrupt signal to the executing process.
 5. A user on Discord sends a command prefixed with “!” and the Discord bot forwards the command to the Mac-based command center, which executes it and replies with a summary.

Functional Requirements
 • Environment & SSH Setup
  – Must support key-based, passwordless SSH from the Mac to the Raspberry Pi
  – The SSH configuration (host, port, username, private key) should be configurable via environment variables or a config file

 • API Server
  – Build an Express-based server running on the Mac
  – Provide a GET /status endpoint to confirm the server is online
  – Provide a POST /execute endpoint that accepts a JSON payload with a natural language command
  – Provide a POST /stop endpoint to interrupt a running command

 • Command Translation
  – Implement a dummy translator function initially, mapping specific natural language inputs (e.g., “RAID status”) to predetermined shell commands
  – Design the system to later integrate with the DeepSeek API for advanced natural language processing

 • SSH Command Execution
  – Utilize the ssh2 library (or equivalent) to execute the translated command on the Raspberry Pi
  – Capture and stream stdout and stderr from the remote command execution

 • Real-Time Output Streaming
  – Integrate Socket.io to push live terminal output and command state updates (e.g., command started, output data, finished, or stopped) to connected web clients

 • Web Interface
  – Provide a LAN-accessible web interface served by the Mac
  – The interface must have two panels:
   • Chat panel for entering natural language commands
   • Terminal panel that displays the live output of executed commands
  – Include control elements such as a “Send Command” button and a “Stop Command” button

 • Discord Integration
  – Integrate with the Discord API using discord.js
  – Listen for messages (e.g., commands starting with “!”) and forward them to the /execute endpoint
  – Reply to Discord with a confirmation containing the original command and its translated version

Non-Functional Requirements
 • Performance
  – Command translation and execution should occur with minimal delay
  – The live terminal streaming must be responsive to user actions

 • Security
  – Endpoints must be protected (with authentication if needed) and only accessible within the trusted LAN environment
  – SSH connections must use key-based authentication, and all sensitive configuration should be stored securely
  – Input commands should be validated against an allowlist to prevent execution of dangerous operations

 • Usability
  – The web interface must be simple and intuitive, with a clear split between command input and output visualization
  – Discord command interactions should provide clear feedback on actions taken

 • Reliability
  – The system should handle network failures gracefully (e.g., SSH interruptions, lost Socket.io connections)
  – Proper error logging and recovery mechanisms must be implemented for debugging and system monitoring

 • Scalability
  – Although designed for a home NAS environment, the architecture should be modular enough to support future enhancements, such as additional channels for input or extended command sets

Dependencies and Assumptions
 • The Mac has Node.js installed and can reliably host the command center
 • The Raspberry Pi is reachable over the LAN and supports SSH access with the required permissions
 • The Discord bot is properly configured and invited to the target Discord server
 • Environment variables or configuration files will be used to store sensitive data (e.g., SSH private key path, Discord token)
 • Initially, a dummy translation function will be used until integration with the DeepSeek API is achieved

Constraints
 • The application is intended to run solely on the LAN and is not exposed to the public Internet
 • Limited hardware resources on the Raspberry Pi (if used for additional tasks) may impose restrictions on the complexity of commands executed remotely
 • The user base is expected to be small (primarily the server administrator), so scaling beyond a single user is not a priority

Milestones and Phases
 Phase 1: Environment Setup and SSH Configuration
  – Generate and distribute SSH keys
  – Verify passwordless SSH from the Mac to the Raspberry Pi

 Phase 2: Initialization of the Node.js Command Center
  – Create and configure the Node.js project
  – Build the basic Express server with /status, /execute, and /stop endpoints
  – Set up configuration management (config.js and environment variables)

 Phase 3: Command Execution Engine and Output Streaming
  – Implement the dummy translator function
  – Integrate SSH command execution via the ssh2 library
  – Set up Socket.io to stream live terminal output to the web interface
  – Implement the stop command functionality

 Phase 4: Discord Bot Integration
  – Develop the Discord bot using discord.js
  – Configure the bot to forward commands to the /execute endpoint and send feedback

 Phase 5: Web Interface Development
  – Create a split-panel web UI (chat panel and terminal panel)
  – Implement command input and live output display using Socket.io
  – Add control buttons (Send Command and Stop Command) and test interactions

 Phase 6: Testing, Refinement, and DeepSeek API Integration
  – Perform end-to-end testing of commands from web and Discord inputs
  – Refine error handling, logging, and security measures
  – Replace the dummy translator with a call to the DeepSeek API
  – Finalize documentation and usage guidelines

Acceptance Criteria
 • The command center server is accessible on the LAN via a web browser and displays a split interface with chat input and live terminal output
 • Natural language commands entered in the web interface or via Discord are successfully translated and executed on the Raspberry Pi through SSH
 • Real-time terminal output is streamed to the web interface, and users can view the full command lifecycle (issuance, output, termination)
 • The “Stop Command” functionality reliably interrupts running commands on the Raspberry Pi
 • The system logs and provides clear error messages if any component (SSH, Discord, API) fails
