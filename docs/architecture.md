• Backend Server
 – Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
 – Framework: Express.js for REST API endpoints and serving static files
 – Real-Time Communication: Socket.io for pushing live command output and status updates to the web client
 – SSH Communication: ssh2 package to connect and execute commands on the Raspberry Pi via SSH
 – HTTP Client: Axios for calling external APIs (e.g., the DeepSeek API) and for inter-module communication (from Discord to the API)
 – Configuration Management: Environment variables and a config file (e.g., config.js) to store settings (port numbers, SSH credentials, DeepSeek API URL, etc.)

• Discord Integration
 – Library: discord.js to create a bot that listens for chat messages and forwards commands to the API server
 – Communication: The bot sends HTTP POST requests (using Axios) to the Express server’s /execute endpoint and receives feedback to reply back to Discord

• Web Interface (Dashboard)
 – Frontend Framework: Plain HTML/JavaScript or optionally a lightweight React/Next.js app
 – Real-Time Communication: Socket.io client for receiving live terminal output and command status updates
 – User Interaction: A split-panel UI with a Chat Panel (to enter natural language commands) and a Terminal Panel (to view real-time output), along with control elements (buttons for “Send Command” and “Stop Command”)

• Infrastructure & Deployment
 – Primary Host: Mac machine acting as the centralized “command center” that hosts the Node.js server, Socket.io service, and Discord bot
 – Remote Host: Raspberry Pi NAS, which is not running the full application but is accessible over the LAN via SSH
 – LAN Accessibility: The web interface is served on the Mac and accessible via its LAN IP address
 – Security: SSH key-based authentication for secure remote command execution; environment variables/config files used for storing sensitive credentials; optionally further security (e.g., JWT, API keys) on the REST endpoints for LAN protection

Architecture Overview
	1.	Command Center on the Mac
 • The Mac runs the central Node.js application.
 • The Express server exposes several REST endpoints:
  – GET /status: To check the server health
  – POST /execute: Accepts a JSON payload with a natural language command
  – POST /stop: Allows interrupting a running command
 • A dummy translator function (to be replaced later with DeepSeek API integration) converts natural language commands into system commands.
 • Once translated, the server uses the ssh2 module to open an SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi and execute the command remotely.
 • The output (stdout/stderr) from the remote command is captured and broadcast in real time to connected clients via Socket.io events (e.g., ‘commandOutput’, ‘commandFinished’, ‘commandStopped’).
	2.	Remote Execution on the Raspberry Pi
 • The Raspberry Pi NAS does not run a full app; it serves as the target system.
 • The Mac command center, via SSH, executes commands on the Pi (e.g., system diagnostics, Docker management, RAID checks).
 • Results from the remote execution are streamed back over the SSH channel and then relayed by the Mac server to the web interface and/or Discord.
	3.	Discord Bot Integration
 • A separate module or integrated component using discord.js listens for messages in Discord channels (e.g., commands starting with “!”).
 • Upon receiving a command, the Discord bot sends an HTTP POST request to the Mac server’s /execute endpoint.
 • The Mac server processes the command as usual and the bot replies in Discord with a summary of the command translation and status.
	4.	Web Interface (Dashboard)
 • The web client (served as static files or through a frontend framework) connects to the Mac server via Socket.io.
 • The user interface is split into two panels:
  – Chat Panel: Where users enter natural language commands; commands are sent to the server via REST calls.
  – Terminal Panel: Displays live command output and status updates received through Socket.io.
 • A “Stop Command” button triggers an HTTP POST to the /stop endpoint, which attempts to interrupt any currently running SSH command on the Raspberry Pi.
	5.	Communication Flow
 • The user submits a command via the web interface or Discord.
 • The command is sent to the Mac server’s /execute endpoint.
 • The server translates the natural language command (using the dummy translator or DeepSeek API).
 • The translated command is sent over SSH to the Raspberry Pi for execution.
 • Real-time output from the Pi is streamed back via the SSH connection and then pushed to connected web clients via Socket.io.
 • The user can observe the complete command lifecycle (issuance, execution, and termination) and can interrupt execution if necessary.

By leveraging this tech stack and architecture, you create a centralized command center that is secure, flexible, and accessible over the LAN. The design ensures that natural language commands are effectively translated, executed on the remote NAS, and monitored in real time, with additional input channels via Discord for enhanced management convenience.
