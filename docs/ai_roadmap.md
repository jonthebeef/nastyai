# AI Integration Roadmap

## Vision Overview

Transform the command center into an intelligent, conversational agent capable of:
- Understanding natural language instructions
- Breaking down complex tasks into executable steps
- Maintaining context through chat history
- Autonomously executing system operations within safety bounds
- Providing a modern, chat-based interface

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current State
- Static command mapping
- One-to-one command execution
- Basic split-panel UI
- No contextual awareness
- No task decomposition
- No conversation memory
- No autonomous decision making

### Target State
- Natural conversation interface
- Intelligent task planning and decomposition
- Context-aware command execution
- Chat history and learning capabilities
- Modern chat UI with terminal integration
- Safe autonomous operations
- Persistent conversation memory

## Technical Architecture

### Chat History System
1. Storage Layer
   - MongoDB for conversation storage
   - Redis for active context caching
   - File system for long-term archives

2. Context Management
   - Sliding window of recent interactions
   - Relevance scoring system
   - Garbage collection for old data

3. Privacy & Security
   - Encryption at rest
   - Data anonymization
   - Configurable retention

### Safety Framework
1. Command Validation
   - Permission boundaries
   - Resource limits
   - Operation blacklists

2. Execution Pipeline
   - Pre-execution checks
   - Staged execution
   - Rollback procedures

3. Monitoring
   - Operation logging
   - Resource tracking
   - Alert thresholds

## Risk Mitigation

### System Safety
- Read-only operations first
- Explicit confirmation flows
- Command restrictions
- Comprehensive logging

### Data Privacy
