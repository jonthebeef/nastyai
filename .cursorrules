# Cursor Rules for Nasty AI Project

## Critical Rule: Configuration Preservation
- **DO NOT** modify any existing configurations on the Pi without explicit permission
- The project's purpose is to READ and USE existing configurations, NOT to change them
- Any configuration changes require EXPRESS permission from the user

## Workflow Rules
1. When working with configurations:
   - ✅ READ existing configurations
   - ✅ USE existing configurations as-is
   - ✅ BUILD new functionality around existing configurations
   - ❌ DO NOT modify existing configurations
   - ❌ DO NOT create new configurations without permission

2. If changes might be needed:
   - First explain WHY changes might be needed
   - Present the proposed changes in detail
   - Wait for EXPLICIT approval
   - Only proceed if given CLEAR permission
   - Document any approved changes

3. Working with existing systems:
   - Understand the current setup first
   - Use existing paths and structures
   - Respect existing permissions and ownership
   - Preserve existing functionality

## Project Focus
- Primary goal is to build a command center that works WITH existing configurations
- Focus on reading and interpreting existing setups
- Add functionality without modifying core configurations
- Maintain compatibility with existing services and setups

## Remember
- When in doubt, ASK first
- Better to ask permission than to break existing functionality
- Preserve and protect the existing infrastructure
- Changes should only be made with clear understanding and explicit approval
